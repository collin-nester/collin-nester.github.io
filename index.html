								<h2 class="major">Research Proposal</h2>
                                <p>This research proposal was the second stage of planning for my investigative field essay, just after brainstorming. It was one of the first times I had to generate and develop a self generated topic for research, and I found writing this artifact to be extremely helpful in clarifying what ideas I wanted to research and how I would go about researching them. Since idea developmnt is the skill I feel I've improved the most on in this class, I wanted to show the point from which I progressed.</p>
                                <blockquote><strong>Research Topic:</strong> The fundamental constraints of Rubik’s cubes<br>
                                    <strong>Question:</strong> What is the physical limit for a human Rubik’s cube Ao5 (average of 5)?<br>
                                    <strong>Key terms:</strong> Rubik’s cube, constraint, CFOP, Roux, algorithm, TPS (turns per second), reaction time<br>
                                    <strong>Potential sources:</strong> I’d like to lay out my argument in three main parts: after an introduction to the
                                    history of cubing discussion about fundamental constraints, I’ll shift to the human physical and
                                    perceptual limits on single times to create a clearer picture of the elements at play in a single solve. I’d
                                    then like to end with a more statistical focus on how exactly using Ao5 further limits the limit proposed
                                    in the first part. The first part of this argument requires use of primary source discussions from cubing
                                    forums and blogs to establish historical context. The second part will use psychological and
                                    physiological evidence regarding human vision, reaction times, and dexterity from journals such as the
                                    journal “Ergonomics” and “The Journal of Vision.” The last part will use the World Cube Association’s
                                    extensive database of solves from top competitors to analyse the time distribution among past world
                                    record Ao5’s as well as statistical journal databases like MathSciNet to utilize correct statistical
                                    methods in generalizing from single solve limitations to Ao5 limitations.
                                    Citation Sources: APA is standard for sciences and there is not a standard citation method for
                                    mathematics, I will be using APA.</blockquote>

								<h2 class="major">Project 2 Reflection Journal</h2>
								<p>This is a written reflection on my comparative rhetorical analysis essay. It discusses my thoughts on the interplay between genre, medium, and audience which I analyzed in the essay. Most of this reflection discusses how developing this essay clarified the ideas we learned in class about the purpose of genre with a concrete example, which was another one of the main ideas I've taken away from this class.</p>
                                <blockquote>I took away a lot of things about how my discourse community communicates, as well as how genre/medium can influence how we communicate. Primarily, I found in these two documents a reflection of trends I see more regularly in the community. The use of videos to communicate with younger audiences is something I've noticed broadly in communication, and this medium fits this framework in the cubing community because of how many young cubers there are. Audiovisual content works very well because, due to factors like naturally high levels of free time, curiosity, and playfulness, children make up the majority of cubing content consumers. Combining this reasoning with the fact that youtube is especially predominant among children makes cubing videos a very natural way to communicate with a broad cubing audience. I also noticed that the high levels of trust we give to experts in the community are not necessarily justified. Feliks Zemdegs made some pretty terrible predictions, the reasons for which I outlined in my essay. It's strange to think that amateur speedcubers make better predictors of times way down the road, but I think it makes sense when you think of how speedcubing improvements work: little by little. When you're stuck looking for improvements in times of less than a tenth of a second, it becomes very difficult to image times dropping a full second or two. That being said, the written genre means that Zemdegs' argument is very easy to trace and pinpoint where the weakness is. Having the ability to quickly identify mistakes is part of what makes the written word so appealing for advanced analysis; and with it being a blog post, its easy for people to point out mistakes they've found through the comments section and hear the writer's response to them.</blockquote>

								<h2 class="major">Reflective Statement</h2>
								<p> &emsp;&emsp;This class has taught me quite a bit about research. Of course, I have done research for classes in the past, but the scope and range of research
                                    in this class is quite a bit larger than it has been in the past. Even generating a fully novel research topic was new and difficult for me at first.
                                    But as we got new projects assigned, ideas for what I could write about sprang forth much more readily than they had for the first project.
                                    At this point, I can confidently say that being assigned a research paper on a subject of my choosing would be an unintimidating prospect. It seems a 
                                    lot less daunting now that I understand how long each step in the process takes. <br><br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;I've also come to understand genre in a new light. The idea of genre as a typified response to a recurring rhetorical situation is a useful framework for
                                    understanding how the presentation of ideas is formatted on a meta level. I've always had a bit of a shock when emerging from the consumption of a certain
                                    genre upon encountering drastically different genres. For example, after spending a lot of time reading a chemistry textbook, watching a youtube video on 
                                    the same subject is very jarring, since they present the same information in very different ways. Why would both of these ways of teaching exist, when
                                    one seems so much better than the other? This class has solidified for me the importance of variety in the types of media we produce and consume. 
                                    From the perspective of a student, a video is much more digestible than reading a textbook. But the textbook isn't just for the student 
                                    learning the material - it's also for the student reviewing the material, or the professor planning lessons to go alongside the readings. Realizing 
                                    that most rhetorical choices I don't understand come from the media being created for a different audience or context has proved to be one of the most 
                                    insightful things I've learned from this class, especially from project 2.
